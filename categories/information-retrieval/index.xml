            </div>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance on a wide variety of NLP tasks. Recently, there has been a growing interest in applying LLMs to zero-shot text ranking. This article describes a recent paradigm that uses prompting-based approaches to directly utilize LLMs as rerankers in a multi-stage ranking pipeline.]]></description>

            </div>Defining positive and negative labels for a retrieval task in a search ranking system is a non-trivial problem. This article goes over various sampling strategies for creating negative and positive pairs for effective representation learning. It introduces the concept of mining hard examples, followed by various strategies to sample hard positive and hard negative pairs. The article includes a lot of tips and learnings based on heuristics and empirical results from a comprehensive set of research papers published across the industry and academia.]]></description>

            </div>Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT-x, PaLM, BLOOM, have shaken up the NLP domain and completely redefined the state-of-the-art for a variety of tasks. One reason for the popularity of these LLMs has been their out-of-the-box capability to produce excellent performance with none to little domain-specific labeled data. The information retrieval community is also witnessing a revolution due to LLMs. These large pre-trained models can understand task instructions specified in natural language and then perform well on tasks in a zero-shot or few-shot manner. In this article, I review this theme and some of the most prominent ideas proposed by researchers in the last few months to enable zero/few-shot learning in text retrieval and ranking applications like search ranking, question answering, fact verification, etc.]]></description>

            </div>Two-tower model is widely adopted in industrial-scale retrieval and ranking workflows across a broad range of application domains, such as content recommendations, advertisement systems, and search engines. It is also the current go-to state-of-the-art solution for pre-ranking tasks. This article explores the history and current state of the Two Tower models and also highlights potential improvements proposed in some of the recently published literature. The goal here is to help understand what makes the Two Tower model an appropriate choice for a bunch of applications, and how it can be potentially extended from its current state.]]></description>

            </div>IntroductionLarge-scale information retrieval applications, such as recommender systems, search ranking, and text analysis often leverage feature interactions for effective modeling. These models are commonly deployed at the ranking stage of the cascade-style systems. In this article, I summarize the need for modeling feature interactions and introduce some of the most popular ML architectures designed around this theme. This article also highlights the high data sparsity issue, that makes it hard for ML algorithms to model second or higher-order feature interactions.]]></description>
