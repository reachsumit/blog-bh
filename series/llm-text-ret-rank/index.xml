            </div>The previous article did a deep dive into the prompting-based pointwise, pairwise, and listwise techniques that directly use LLMs to perform reranking. In this article, we will take a closer look at some of the shortcomings of the prompting methods and explore the latest efforts to train ranking-aware LLMs. The article also describes several strategies to build effective and efficient LLM-based rerankers.]]></description>

            </div>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance on a wide variety of NLP tasks. Recently, there has been a growing interest in applying LLMs to zero-shot text ranking. This article describes a recent paradigm that uses prompting-based approaches to directly utilize LLMs as rerankers in a multi-stage ranking pipeline.]]></description>

            </div>Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT-x, PaLM, BLOOM, have shaken up the NLP domain and completely redefined the state-of-the-art for a variety of tasks. One reason for the popularity of these LLMs has been their out-of-the-box capability to produce excellent performance with none to little domain-specific labeled data. The information retrieval community is also witnessing a revolution due to LLMs. These large pre-trained models can understand task instructions specified in natural language and then perform well on tasks in a zero-shot or few-shot manner. In this article, I review this theme and some of the most prominent ideas proposed by researchers in the last few months to enable zero/few-shot learning in text retrieval and ranking applications like search ranking, question answering, fact verification, etc.]]></description>
