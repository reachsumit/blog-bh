    <description><![CDATA[Many machine learning domains, such as recommender systems, targeted advertisement, search ranking, and text analysis contain highly sparse data because of the large categorical variable domains. This sparsity makes it hard for ML algorithms to model second-order and above feature interactions. In this article, I summarize the need for modeling feature interactions and introduce some of the most popular ML architectures designed for estimating interactions from sparse data.
Introduction Problem with sparse inputs A variety of Information Retrieval and Data Mining tasks, such as Recommender Systems, Targeted Advertising, Search Ranking, etc.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Different Flavors of Recommenders At a high-level, Recommender systems work based on two different strategies (or a hybrid of the two) for recommending content.
Collaborative Filtering: Algorithms that use usage data, such as explicit or implicit feedback from the user. Content-based Filtering: Algorithms that use content metadata and user profile. For example, a movie can be profiled based on its genre, IMDb ratings, box-office sales, etc., and a user can be profile based on their demographic information or their answers to an onboarding survey.]]></description>
