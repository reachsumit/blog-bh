    <description><![CDATA[A traditional cloud-to-edge recommender system can&rsquo;t respond to user engagement and interests in real time. This article introduces on-device inference and on-device learning paradigms that can capture rich user behavior and respond to users&rsquo; changing interests in real time. The article also goes through system design choices and implementation details of different industrial applications that have served recommendations to billions of users, such as Kuaishou&rsquo;s Short Video Recommendation on Mobile Devices, and Taobao&rsquo;s (Alibaba) on-device recommender systems.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Two-tower model is widely adopted in industrial-scale retrieval and ranking workflows across a broad range of application domains, such as content recommendations, advertisement systems, and search engines. It is also the current go-to state-of-the-art solution for pre-ranking tasks. This article explores the history and current state of the Two Tower models and also highlights potential improvements proposed in some of the recently published literature. The goal here is to help understand what makes the Two Tower model an appropriate choice for a bunch of applications, and how it can be potentially extended from its current state.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Many machine learning domains, such as recommender systems, targeted advertisement, search ranking, and text analysis contain highly sparse data because of the large categorical variable domains. This sparsity makes it hard for ML algorithms to model second-order and above feature interactions. In this article, I summarize the need for modeling feature interactions and introduce some of the most popular ML architectures designed for estimating interactions from sparse data.

    <description><![CDATA[This article explains what explicit and implicit feedback data means for recommender systems. We discuss their characteristics and peculiarities concerning collaborative filtering based algorithms. Then we go over one of the most popular collaborative filtering algorithms for implicit data and implement it in Python with an example dataset.]]></description>
