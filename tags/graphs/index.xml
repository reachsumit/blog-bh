            </div>The previous article &ldquo;A Guide to Graph Representation Learning&rdquo; provided a comprehensive introduction to the state of graph representation learning, along with a review of the basic terminologies, techniques, and applications. If you are new to the graph learning domain, I&rsquo;d highly recommend you read the previous article first. This article takes a closer look at different types of shallow graph embedding models of homogeneous graphs. It also highlights a few real-world applications that build upon some of these ideas.]]></description>

            </div>In recent years, there has been a significant amount of research activity in the graph representation learning domain. These learning methods help in analyzing abstract graph structures in information networks and improve the performances of state-of-the-art machine learning solutions for real-world applications, such as social recommendations, targeted advertising, user search, etc. This article provides a comprehensive introduction to the graph representation learning domain, including common terminologies, deterministic and stochastic modeling techniques, taxonomy, evaluation methods, and applications.]]></description>
