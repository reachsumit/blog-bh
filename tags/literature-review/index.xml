            </div>Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT-x, PaLM, BLOOM, have shaken up the NLP domain and completely redefined the state-of-the-art for a variety of tasks. One reason for the popularity of these LLMs has been their out-of-the-box capability to produce excellent performance with none to little domain-specific labeled data. The information retrieval community is also witnessing a revolution due to LLMs. These large pre-trained models can understand task instructions specified in natural language and then perform well on tasks in a zero-shot or few-shot manner. In this article, I review this theme and some of the most prominent ideas proposed by researchers in the last few months to enable zero/few-shot learning in text retrieval and ranking applications like search ranking, question answering, fact verification, etc.]]></description>

            </div>Modern time series forecasting requires a model to learn from multiple related time series. These time series often number in thousands or millions. Traditional statistical models do not scale well to these settings because they learn individual series in isolation and do not share parameters across series. Various deep learning models have been proposed recently with different inductive biases to work effectively under these settings. This article explores some of the most popular advances in deep learning architectures for modern time series forecasting.]]></description>

            </div>Many machine learning domains, such as recommender systems, targeted advertisement, search ranking, and text analysis contain highly sparse data because of the large categorical variable domains. This sparsity makes it hard for ML algorithms to model second-order and above feature interactions. In this article, I summarize the need for modeling feature interactions and introduce some of the most popular ML architectures designed for estimating interactions from sparse data.
