    <description><![CDATA[Over recent decades, Machine Learning (ML) and, its subdomain, Deep Learning (DL) based algorithms have achieved remarkable success in various areas, such as image processing, natural language understanding, and speech recognition. However, ML algorithms haven&rsquo;t quite had the same widely known and unquestionable superiority when it comes to forecasting applications in the time series domain. While ML algorithms have to overcome the challenges in modeling the non-i.i.d. nature of data inherent in the time series domain, statistical models excel in this setting and provide explicit means to model time series structural elements, such as trend and seasonality.]]></description>

    <title>Recommender Systems for Modeling Feature Interactions under Sparse Settings</title>

    <description><![CDATA[Many machine learning domains, such as recommender systems, targeted advertisement, search ranking, and text analysis contain highly sparse data because of the large categorical variable domains. This sparsity makes it hard for ML algorithms to model second-order and above feature interactions. In this article, I summarize the need for modeling feature interactions and introduce some of the most popular ML architectures designed for estimating interactions from sparse data.
Introduction Problem with sparse inputs A variety of Information Retrieval and Data Mining tasks, such as Recommender Systems, Targeted Advertising, Search Ranking, etc.]]></description>

    <title>Collaborative Filtering based Recommender Systems for Implicit Feedback Data</title>

    <description><![CDATA[Different Flavors of Recommenders At a high-level, Recommender systems work based on two different strategies (or a hybrid of the two) for recommending content.
Collaborative Filtering: Algorithms that use usage data, such as explicit or implicit feedback from the user. Content-based Filtering: Algorithms that use content metadata and user profile. For example, a movie can be profiled based on its genre, IMDb ratings, box-office sales, etc., and a user can be profile based on their demographic information or their answers to an onboarding survey.]]></description>

    <title>Towards Empathetic Dialogue Systems</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Recognizing feelings in the conversation partner and replying empathetically is a trivial skill for humans. But how can we infuse empathy into responses generated by a conversational dialogue agent or any of the text generation algorithm in Natural Language Processing? In this article, I will describe what empathy means through the lens of various academic disciplines and then do an in-depth review of the prior and current state-of-the-art NLU systems that can simulate empathy.</p>]]></description>
