            </div>The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is a classical ensemble learning technique originally proposed by Jacobs et. al1 in 1991. MoEs have the capability to substantially scale up the model capacity and only introduce small computation overhead. This ability combined with recent innovations in the deep learning domain has led to the wide-scale adoption of MoEs in healthcare, finance, pattern recognition, etc. They have been successfully utilized in large-scale applications such as Large Language Modeling (LLM), Machine Translation, and Recommendations.]]></description>

            </div><p>Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought a significant paradigm shift in Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain. These pretrained language models encode an extensive amount of world knowledge, and they can be applied to a multitude of downstream NLP applications with zero or just a handful of demonstrations.</p>
<p>While existing recommender systems mainly focus on behavior data, large language models encode extensive world knowledge mined from large-scale web corpora. Hence these LLMs store knowledge that can complement the behavior data. For example, an LLM-based system, like ChatGPT, can easily recommend buying turkey on Thanksgiving day, in a zero-shot manner, even without having click behavior data related to turkeys or Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Many researchers have recently proposed different approaches to building recommender systems using LLMs. These methods convert different recommendation tasks into either language understanding or language generation templates. This article highlights the prominent work done on this theme.</p>]]></description>

            </div>Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT-x, PaLM, BLOOM, have shaken up the NLP domain and completely redefined the state-of-the-art for a variety of tasks. One reason for the popularity of these LLMs has been their out-of-the-box capability to produce excellent performance with none to little domain-specific labeled data. The information retrieval community is also witnessing a revolution due to LLMs. These large pre-trained models can understand task instructions specified in natural language and then perform well on tasks in a zero-shot or few-shot manner. In this article, I review this theme and some of the most prominent ideas proposed by researchers in the last few months to enable zero/few-shot learning in text retrieval and ranking applications like search ranking, question answering, fact verification, etc.]]></description>

            </div>Modern time series forecasting requires a model to learn from multiple related time series. These time series often number in thousands or millions. Traditional statistical models do not scale well to these settings because they learn individual series in isolation and do not share parameters across series. Various deep learning models have been proposed recently with different inductive biases to work effectively under these settings. This article explores some of the most popular advances in deep learning architectures for modern time series forecasting.]]></description>
