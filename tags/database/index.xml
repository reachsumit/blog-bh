    <description><![CDATA[In the last couple of articles, I reviewed literary surveys on SQL vs NoSQL vs NewSQL paradigm. I also went over some of the key concepts that will help you in understanding the motivation behind each type of the NoSQL database. I then explained different NoSQL data storage models, along with strengths, weaknesses and specific application areas of each of those models. If you haven&rsquo;t yet checked out those posts, I recommend checking them out: SQL vs NoSQL vs NewSQL: An In-depth Literature Review, and Comparing NoSQL Models: A Guide for Selecting the Best-fitting Database Model.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[In the last article, I did a literature review defining the origin of SQL, NoSQL, and NewSQL. I also went over the important theorems and properties that could help in the categorization and comparison of the different types of databases. If you haven&rsquo;t read that article yet, I highly recommend you to go over it: SQL vs NoSQL vs NewSQL: An In-depth Literature Review. In this article, we will build upon those concepts and learn how to categorize NoSQL databases based on the type of data we intend to store.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[SQL Databases Origin The concept of Relational Databases was originally developed in the 1970s by IBM 1. They are also known as SQL (Structured Query Language) databases, named after the query language used for managing data in Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS). Over multiple years of research and development, an unmatched level of reliability, stability, and strong mechanisms to store and query data have been baked into Relational Databases. They have been the storage of choice for a majority of transactional data management applications such as banking, airline reservation, online e-commerce, and supply chain management applications.]]></description>
